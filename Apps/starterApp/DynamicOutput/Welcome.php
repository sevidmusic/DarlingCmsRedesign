        Welcome to the Darling Data Management System,
        a tool designed to aide in the development of
        well organized PHP applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are viewing the starterApp App which is
        intended to serve as a demo, and can also be
        used as a base to develop a new App.
        To use the starterApp app as the base for a
        new app, make a copy of Apps/starterApp with an
        appropriate name, and place it in the Apps
        directory, i.e., Apps/NewAppName.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can then modify this new Apps source code
        to suit your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The benefit of using the starterApp as a base is you start
        out with a working app with some defaults that can be used
        as they are, or server as a guide to help you figure out
        what customizations you need to make to create your App.
    </p>
    <p>
        To learn about how to develop with the Darling Data Management System,
        take a look at the starterApp's source code, or use dsh -r Documentation
        to start up the Documentation app which provides detailed information
        on how the Darling Data Management System works, and how you can use
        it to accomplish your goals.
