        Create a video to share with others about voting, post
        it on Youtube, send us the URL, and, if appropriate* we
        will post it on the site, for others to view and share.

        The video can be about the history of black voting,
        current events, you and people you know talking about
        voting or the issues you care about. You can record
        yourself singing a song you have written, or reading
        a poem. You can play the audio over photographs or clips.

        Of course we want everyone to vote, but Union Of Minority
        Neighborhoodsâ€™ BlackBallotPower is focusing on connecting
        and communicating with Black Voters. Videos which speak to
        our community will be a top priority for our contest winners.
