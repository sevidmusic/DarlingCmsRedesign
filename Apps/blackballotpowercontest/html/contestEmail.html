                            Create a video to share with others about voting, post it on Youtube,
                            send us the URL, and, if appropriate* we will post it on the site,
                            for others to view, vote for and share.

                            The most popular videos will be judged by entertainment professionals.
                            We will promote the winning videos in all ways possible .

            <span style="display: block; padding: 1em;">
                            The video can be about the history of black voting, current events,
                            you and people you know talking about voting or the issues you care
                            about. You can record yourself singing a song you have written, or
                            reading a poem. You can play the audio over photographs or clips.
                            Pretty much whatever you want.
