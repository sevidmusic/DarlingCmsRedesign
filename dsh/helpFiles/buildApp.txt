dsh --build-app | -b [APP_NAME] [DOMAIN] : Build an App for a specified [DOMAIN]
by running Apps/[APP_NAME]/Components.php file.

If [DOMAIN] is not specified then the domain defined in the App's
Components.php file will be used.

[APP_NAME] : The name of the App to build.

[DOMAIN] : The domain to build the App for.

Example:

dsh -b AppName http://localhost:8080/

WARNING: dsh will not prevent you from building an App multiple times for
         the same [DOMAIN], whether or not this is problematic depends
         on the App being built.
