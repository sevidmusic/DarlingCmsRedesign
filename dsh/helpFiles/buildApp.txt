dsh --build-app [APP_NAME] [DOMAIN]

Description:

Build an App for a specified [DOMAIN] by running the App's
Components.php file via php.

Note: A Components.php file MUST be defined for the App at:
      Apps/[APP_NAME]/Components.php

Shorthand:

dsh -b [APP_NAME] [DOMAIN]

Arguments:

[APP_NAME] : The name of the App to build.

[DOMAIN]   : The domain to build the App for.
             If [DOMAIN] is not specified then the domain defined
             in the App's Components.php file will be used.
Example:

dsh -b AppName http://localhost:8080/

WARNING: dsh will not prevent you from building an App multiple times for
         the same [DOMAIN], whether or not this is problematic depends
         on the App being built.
