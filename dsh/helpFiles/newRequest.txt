dsh --new Request [APP_NAME] [REQUEST_NAME] [REQUEST_CONTAINER] [RELATIVE_URL]

Description:

Creates a new Request configuration file at Apps/[APP_NAME]/Requests/[REQUEST_NAME].php

Shorthand:

dsh -n Request [APP_NAME] [REQUEST_NAME] [REQUEST_CONTAINER] [RELATIVE_URL]

Arguments:

[APP_NAME]          The name of the app the Request will be defined for.

[REQUEST_NAME]      An alphanumeric name to assign to the Request.

[REQUEST_CONTAINER] The container to assign to the Request.

[RELATIVE_URL]      The relative url to assign to the Request.

                    This is a string that represents the part of the url
                    following the domain the App was built for.

                    For example, if an App named Foo is built for the domain
                    http://localhost:8080 then a [RELATIVE_URL] of index.php
                    would assign http://localhost:8080/index.php as the
                    Request's url.

                    You MUST only specify the relative url, do not include
                    the domain!

                    This will insure that the Request's actual url will be
                    correct regarless of what domain the App is built for.

Example:

    dsh -n Request AppName RequestName RequestContainer index.php?foo=bare
